  #  different lists of users log on as a service. A good example could be that a
  # certain application requires that "appuer" can log on as a service, but not all
  # servers have this application. How could you handle that?

  # Still neeed this ^^

  # Ben: Are you after something like this? using a paramater which can be changed when the class is called?
